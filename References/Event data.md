# Excerpts from Growing Pains (2016): 

In the past 40 years, there are collective efforts in using newspaper articles to create automated-coding global-scale databases of events. 

Automated event coding parses individual
sentences into SUBJECT VERB OBJECT format and categorizes the action using a framework like CAMEO (Conflict and Mediation
Event Observations). So a statement like “Secretary of State John Kerry complained about
Russia’s support of Syria’s Bashar al-Assad”
would be coded as US GOVERNMENT/DISAPPROVE/RUSSIAN GOVERNMENT. This
can be refined into a numeric level of hostility or cooperation by using scales like the
Goldstein Score. [CAMEO is most often used to categorize domestic and international conflict, but it could capture any kinds of interactions in the news media.]


Hand-coded and automated data can be used to do forecasting.

Issues: 
1. The focus on sentences misses a lot of nuances
2. Event data program have inconsistent corpuses over time.
3. Reliability: different sources of event data have little consistency for identifying the real-world events.
4. Validiity: computer-automated event data often duplicate and misclassify events. 

Some event data mentioned:
1.  International Crisis Early Warning System (ICEWS)
2.  Global Data on Events Language and Tone (GDELT) from Georgetown
3.  Social, Political, and Economic Event Database (SPEED) from UIUC
