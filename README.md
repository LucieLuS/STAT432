# Mentoring21SP


## Literatue review on classification (what are the methods we can use?)

- In progress
## Web-script data (public agenda: posted on Github then we need to turn it into excel format)

- Explained where and how the trending data are stored in .md format in other Github repository. We need to change the existing scrippted files to one program-readable file (excel or other format).

## Write a machine-learning algorithm to classify the categories of the posts and trending searches

- Explained what the end goals of the algorithm look like.
- Ideal: the computer can pick up the common characteristics of the posts in the hand-coded labels and be able to do it automatically. (supervised)
- Less ideal but fine: the computer assign labels to the posts. The labels are broad but somehow accurate. 


## Web-script data: Look at a few other social media accounts on Weibo. (API)
## Come up with an analysis plan for the data (training data 54 days): look at it from different angles
## Clean up the data so it is ready to run the analysis
## Data visualization for the current analysis that I have
