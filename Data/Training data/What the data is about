Those hot searches give us a good sense of the topics to which people pay attention day by day. 

The timeframe is 54 days from November 8th to December 2019. Although the list of the top 50 trending searches has up-to-the-minute updates, the platform was only crawled twice per day, totaling 5,400 searches. ([Here is the link](https://github.com/Writeup007/weibo_Hot_Search_Data). 

Topics of celebrities, movies, shows and commercial advertisements were excluded. 
In fact, a majority of the trending searches are not relevant in this project: 
only 17.6% of them, 951 trending searches regarding political and social issues are kept under this study. (*note to myself: maybe we need to keep the entire sample*)


I collect the Weibo posts within the same period from the state-run media, Peopleâ€™s Daily, to proxy policy agendas. 
I also exclude topics of pure entertainment and pop culture, keeping 454 posts for analysis. It posts on average 12 posts per day.
