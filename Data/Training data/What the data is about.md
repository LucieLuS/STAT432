 At this stage, I only focus on one of the major social media platforms in China, Sina Weibo, and describe it as a public spectacle to show what the public views as salient issues and show the extent to which the state media are responsive to the public agenda.
 
Here, I use daily trending searches on Weibo as a proxy of public agendas. Trending searches that are searched the most by the users will appear highly in the list. A short list of topics that score the top of the "hot" list is available below the searching bar. This is a way of measuring citizens' interestingness of the news and issues of the day on the platform. 

More critically, trending searches are similar to news headlines that give valuable information about an event, more comprehensive than a standard hashtag. The list of trending searches automatically showcase on users’ surface, so even if readers do not have a specific interest in political events, they can still easily stay informed. If they are interested in a specific event, they can dig deeper by clicking on a hot search and reading the relevant tweets. This type of data allows us to observe swiftly changing temporal patterns in topic salience. 

Those trending searches give us a good sense of the topics to which people pay attention day by day. The timeframe is **54** days from November 8th to December 2019. Although the list of the top 50 trending searches has up-to-the-minute updates, the platform was only crawled twice per day, totaling 5,400 searches. ([Here is the link](https://github.com/Writeup007/weibo_Hot_Search_Data)). 

Topics of celebrities, movies, shows and commercial advertisements were excluded. In fact, a majority of the trending searches are not relevant in this project: 
only 17.6% of them, 951 trending searches regarding political and social issues are kept under this study. (*note to myself: maybe we need to keep the entire sample*)


I collect the Weibo posts within the same period from the state-run media, People’s Daily, to proxy policy agendas. I also exclude topics of pure entertainment and pop culture, keeping 454 posts for analysis. It posts on average 12 posts per day. The People’s Daily is a national newspaper and central party organ, generally perceived as the voice of the Communist Party. In China, it is safe to assume that the party elites use authoritative media to respond to public demands instead of using a personal Weibo account. The People’s Daily is generally perceived as an authoritative voice of the Communist Party. The People’s Daily is also influential: its posts have over a million readership daily on average and the potential of reaching millions of Weibo users. Therefore, this can be a tool for the incumbent leader to demonstrate responsiveness to the public.
